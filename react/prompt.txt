I'm going to write a react app.

There're 3 pages:
1. route page
2. manage page
3. search page

#### route page:
only 2 buttons, route page to 'manage page' or 'search page' when click it

#### manage page:
there's a list view contains a list of 'url' items
users can add an item into list and remove an item from list
'url' item contains properties named url as string type, when add item, there should be a dialog to pop up and click ok to add it.

### search page
this page contains two part, part one contains 'input text' and 'search button';
part 2 contains many card view layout as grid layout, in each card there's image and name inside it.
